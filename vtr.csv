Anemic REST,Hold,Techniques,TRUE,"Naively developing services that simply expose static, hierarchical data models via templated URLs result in an anemic REST implementation. In a richly modeled domain, REST should enable more than simple repetitive data fetching. In a fully evolved RESTful architecture, business events and abstract concepts are also modeled as resources, and the implementation should make effective use of hypertext, link relations and media types to maximize decoupling between services."
